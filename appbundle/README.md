# `appbundle` module

Appbundle module for Only Android apps

# Components

This library is a part of Android app, it also contain resource as icon, xml files...
I gather and customize some famous libraries as `ButterKnife` named as
`appbundle/binder`, `Eventbus` named as `appbundle/eventbus`.

Specially, this library contains an architecture based on MVC, located at `appbundle/arch`.
You can use it to separate your app to many pieces, so many people in your team can work together
without worry of conflicting.
