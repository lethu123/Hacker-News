# About vml

This sub-module is `ViewModel-ViewLogic` for App Design Pattern.

## Background

Start from `MVC` design pattern (DP), we customize `VC` part it to make large team can work
together smoothly since this DP can `separate source code to multiple ViewModels and ViewLogics`
as well.

## Implementation

Suppose we have a complex Home screen, to make each Java file do simple and maybe do not exceed
~300 lines, we must separate logic to multiple parts. In below snapshot, we use 1 View, 2 ViewModels
and 2 ViewLogics.
